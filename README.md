# House Marketplace

This project was completed during the React Front to Back 2022 course. This project utilizes React and Firebase to create an app that allows users to view places for rent/sale and create their own listings. Users are able to view listings without being logged in and are able to sign up to create listings. In the house directories, we make use of pagination to limit the number of places that are shown at a time.
